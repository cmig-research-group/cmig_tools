Found a bug? First, check the [Issues](https://github.com/cmig-research-group/cmig_tools/issues) tab to make sure that it is not an already reported issue. If it does not exist, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/cmig-research-group/cmig_tools/issues/new). Ideally, an issue should contain as much information as possible to give us an understanding of the problem at hand. If you think something is a bug, it would be great if you can include an explanation of why you think it is a bug and (if possible) what should be the replacement. [Reproducible minimal examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) are great!

Thought of an enhancement? Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/cmig-research-group/cmig_tools/issues/new) for review and include as much detail as possible, explaining the feature and the expected impact.

If you are facing a specific problem, remember to report some minimal information so that we can try to understand what is not working. For example, if you are encountering an error when calling `FEMA_fit`, we suggest including the following in your issue: number of observations, number of outcome variables, which random effects are being modeled, what are FID and IID being set to, single or double precision, number of bins, covariance type, any optional parameters, and your code snippet that calls `FEMA_fit`.

Generally, if you want to make changes to the code yourself, you can fork this repo, make changes on your forked version, test the changes, and then submit a pull request. An overview of this process is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)

If you have questions about using our tools, we suggest taking a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/cmig-research-group/cmig_tools/wiki). If that does not answer your question, you can use the [Discussions](https://github.com/cmig-research-group/cmig_tools/discussions) area to ask a question.
