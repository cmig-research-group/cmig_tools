 nearestSPD - the nearest (in Frobenius norm) Symmetric Positive Definite matrix to A
 usage: Ahat = nearestSPD(A)

 From Higham: "The nearest symmetric positive semidefinite matrix in the
 Frobenius norm to an arbitrary real matrix A is shown to be (B + H)/2,
 where H is the symmetric polar factor of B=(A + A')/2."

 arguments: (input)
  A - square matrix, which will be converted to the nearest Symmetric
    Positive Definite Matrix.

 Arguments: (output)
  Ahat - The matrix chosen as the nearest SPD matrix to A.

 This modified version has a max number of iterations; if for any reason
 the nearest SPD has not been found by then, return the version that was
 available at that iteration and set converge to false - prevents infinite
 loop - PP (24 Feb 2025)
