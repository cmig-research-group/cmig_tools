 Runs a mediation analysis (Sobel's test) on nested models using output from FEMA_wrapper.m (Sobel, 1990)
 The mediation effect is calculated as (τ – τ'). This is the change in the magnitude of the effect that
 the independent variable (IV) has on the dependent variable (DV) after controlling for the mediator.
 `IVname` specifies the IV of interest.
 The DV is always the imaging phenotype.
 The mediator is the variable that is present in the full model but not the reduced model.
