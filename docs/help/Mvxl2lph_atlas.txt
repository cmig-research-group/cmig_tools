 Mvxl2lph_atlas return the canonical Mvxl2lph transform for current atlas

   M = Mvxl2lph_atlas(atlas)

 (Note, the M_atl field in many prerendered atlases is different: 
   a) converts from voxel to RAS
   b) has a center that is off by 1 mm

   to convert this back to that format: M_LPH_TO_RAS*Mvxl2lph (e.g. to use if calling ctx_mgh2ctx)
